Milestone 1 Report

After I realize project proposal is difficult to achieve, so I decide to make a new project.
In this milestone I am trying to develop a single-player bash-brick game. The player 
control their bash-board on the same machine using keyboard inputs. There should be at 
least one score item on the playfield. A player scores when his or her success to hit 
the brick and never let the ball miss the bash-board, and the score will increase by 
success hitting one unit brick. The game end when bash-board miss the ball.
?	
Client:
?	1.Text fields to specify the player¡¯s IDs
?	2.One Bash-board control the ball movement by different keyboard inputs
?	3.The score of the single player


The challenge is working a project by an individual, I must have ability to work without
 constant supervision, and the ability to see each error and fix them, and the ability 
of programming skill. Also the difficulty for the project is the deliverables, I should 
turn this project in before the due date. And this is my first time to write a mini 
game with HTML language. 
Blocking process:
Issue with sign in system.
